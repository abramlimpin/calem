In Latin language, Calem means dove, which symbolizes for peace. Calem will be like an avatar for the application. It will be your security guard to be aware, to locate or even to evade the crimes happening nearby. 

The application will help the user to be aware by giving out yearly, monthly, quarterly, daily crime reports that was happened in a particular area. This will also help you locate a map that contains crime reports in the respective areas. Moreover, it show the crime information on the wider area; while if you zoom in, it separates the crime information from a specific place to another in that area. It can even filter out on what type of crime you are interested to check out. Another thing, this will guide you how to evade crimes, such as giving some advices and tips from the experts. It can also alert you if the crimes are happening nearby. 

Furthermore, the user can report the crime happening. A way to validate the information that was given is that people, who witnesses the crime and has this app can confirm if this is true or not. 
To make all these functions work, the users must have internet access and the application was installed on their device. However, if you are offline, you can still able to access the installed application using the updates from your recent internet access.
